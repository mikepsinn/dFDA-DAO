# ☠ Slowed Growth in Life Expectancy

**Slowed Growth in Life Expectancy**

From 1890 to 1960, every decade saw a 4-year increase in human lifespan. This amazingly linear growth rate had followed millennia with a flat human lifespan of around 28 years.&#x20;

The growth in the average age of death occurred simultaneously with the following medical innovations.

**Schools of Medicine**

An influx of new state-affiliated pharmacy schools in the [1880s and 1890s](http://acshist.scs.illinois.edu/bulletin\_open\_access/v28-1/v28-1%20p9-17.pdf). The growth in schools of medicine trained physicians and researchers in the systematic collection of clinical data on the safety and efficacy of treatments. They also served as hubs where new medical discoveries could be shared.

**Medical Journals**

The advent of journals such as the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) allowed discoveries to be widely disseminated.

**AMA Drug Certifications**

In 1905, the AMA formed its own Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, which levied a fee on manufacturers to evaluate their drugs for quality (ingredient testing) and safety. Drugs accepted by the Council could carry the AMA’s Seal of Acceptance. The AMA’s Chemical Laboratory tested commercial statements about the composition and purity of drugs in their labs. The Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry followed up with safety\
and rudimentary efficacy evaluations designed to eliminate exaggerated or misleading therapeutic claims. The Seal was awarded to drugs that provided symptomatic relief.

**Cooperative Investigations**

During the 1920s, ’30s, and ’40s, medical researchers began to conduct “cooperative investigations.” These were designed to overcome errors attributed to individual observers working in relative isolation, and instead replaced them with standardized evaluations of therapeutic research in hundreds of patients.

**1950's - FDA Protects Americans from the Thalidomide Disaster**

In the late 1950s, thalidomide became available in 46 countries (**but not the U.S.**) to treat nausea associated with morning sickness during pregnancy. Unfortunately, the potential side effects were not fully understood. As a result, thousands of children were born with congenital disabilities, most notably phocomelia (limb malformations).

Fortunately, the existing 1938 FDA safety requirements **completely protected Americans** from the fate of Europe. However, amid the terrifying news reports of the tragedy, the U.S. government felt compelled to do something in response.

### 1962 - Kefauver Harris Efficacy Amendment.

As effective safety regulations were already in place, the government chose to restrict the production of new treatments, primarily by requiring extensive additional efficacy testing via the 1962 **Kefauver Harris Amendment**.

**Reduction in New Treatments**

The new regulatory clampdown on approvals immediately reduced the production of new treatments by 70%.

**Slowed Growth in Lifespan**

Over the previous 50 years, rapid advancements in medical science had produced a 4-year increase in human lifespan every decade. This amazingly linear growth rate had followed millennia with a flat human lifespan of around 28 years. Following this new 70% reduction in the pace of medical progress, the growth in human lifespan was immediately cut in half to an increase of 2 years per decade.

### Diminishing Returns? <a href="#diminishing-returns" id="diminishing-returns"></a>

You might say, "It seems more likely -- or as likely -- to me that drug development provides diminishing returns to life expectancy." However, diminishing returns produce a slope of exponential decay. It may be partially responsible, but it's not going to produce a sudden change in the linear slope of a curve as linear as life expectancy was before and after the FDA.

Additionally, we're only three lifetimes from George Washington. The modern scientific method has only been systematically applied to medicine for .0001% of human history. However, the more clinical research studies I read, the more I realize we don't know. We know almost nothing compared to what will eventually be known about the human body. And the currently highly restrictive, overly cautious method of clinical research prevents us from knowing more, faster. We're at the very beginning of thousands or millions of years of systematic discovery. So it's unlikely that this decline in lifespan growth resulted from diminishing returns due to our running out of things to discover.

**2 Year Drug Lag**

It currently takes over ten years for a life-saving drug to make its way through the FDA's regulatory process and become available to dying patients. Following the 1962 increase in U.S. regulations, one can see a divergence from the growth in life expectancy in Switzerland, which did not introduce the same delays to availability.

Perhaps it's a coincidence, but you can see an increase in drug approvals in the '80s, and at the same time, the gap between Switzerland and the U.S. gets smaller then. Then U.S. approvals decreased in the '90s, and the gap expanded again.
