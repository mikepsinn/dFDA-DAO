# üé© Oligopolies Protect Existing Inferior Treatments

Industry agitation surrounding the ‚Äúdrug lag‚Äù finally led to modifying the drug patenting system in the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984. This further extended the life of drug patents. Thus, Kefauver's amendments ultimately made drugs more expensive by granting longer monopolies.

**Oligopolies Protect Existing Inferior Treatments**

Before 1962, a brilliant scientist could develop a new treatment, raise $74 million for safety and efficacy testing, and bring it to market. With the current cost of getting a new therapy to patients over a billion dollars, there are only a handful of companies with enough money to risk hundreds of millions on a 90% chance of rejection by the FDA. So today, the brilliant scientist goes to one of these companies, and the company buys the patent for several million dollars. It's likely the drug company already has an existing inferior drug on the market that they've already spent a billion dollars getting approved.

Then the drug company has two options:

**Option 1: Risk $1 billion on clinical trials**

**Possibility A:** Drug is one of the 90% the FDA rejects. GIVE BANKER A BILLION DOLLARS. DO NOT PASS GO.

**Possibility B:** Drug turns out to be one of the 10% the FDA approves. Yay!!! Now it's time to try to recover that billion dollars. However, very few drug companies have enough money to survive this game. So, this company almost certainly already has an inferior drug on the market to treat the same condition. Hence, any profit from this drug will likely be subtracted from revenue from existing, less effective drugs they've already spent a billion dollars on.

**Option 2: Put the patent on the shelf**

Do not take a 90% chance of wasting a billion dollars on failed trials. Do not risk making your already approved cash-cow drugs obsolete.

What's the benefit of bringing better treatment to market if you lose a billion dollars? Either way, the profit incentive is entirely in favor of just buying better treatments and shelving them.

The current flat line in US lifespan growth and chronic disease burden is completely consistent with a system that completely disincentivizes medical progress.
