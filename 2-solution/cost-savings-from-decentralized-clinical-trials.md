  Decentralized Clinical Trials Can Achieve Net Financial Benefits of 5X to 14X,
  Due to Reduced Trial Timelines and Other Factors

# ðŸŒŽ Cost Savings from Decentralized Clinical Trials

* **Net financial benefit:** In phase II studies, the typical DCT deployment for a clinical trial resulting in a one to three month time savings yields a net benefit that is up to five times greater than the upfront investment required. In phase III studies, a similar time savings yields a net benefit that is up to [14 times greater](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220113005740/en/New-Study-Decentralized-Clinical-Trials-Can-Achieve-Net-Financial-Benefits-of-5X-to-14X-Due-to-Reduced-Trial-Timelines-and-Other-Factors) than the upfront investment required.
* **Shorter clinical trial times**: Cycle time reductions associated with DCT deployments had a substantially greater impact on net financial benefits than any other factor. Nearly 85 percent of all clinical trials will experience some sort of delay, with the financial impact of [$600,000 to $8 million](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220113005740/en/New-Study-Decentralized-Clinical-Trials-Can-Achieve-Net-Financial-Benefits-of-5X-to-14X-Due-to-Reduced-Trial-Timelines-and-Other-Factors) per day of delay. Faster trial completion through decentralized methodologies can drive significant cost savings.
* **Lower screening failure rates**: Less than 5 percent of the U.S. population participates in clinical research, and up to [50 percent of trials are not completed](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220113005740/en/New-Study-Decentralized-Clinical-Trials-Can-Achieve-Net-Financial-Benefits-of-5X-to-14X-Due-to-Reduced-Trial-Timelines-and-Other-Factors) because of insufficient enrollment. DCTs shift the paradigm to enable greater patient participation, reduced time and travel burden, faster screening, more convenient consent and enrollment, and in some cases, remote delivery of an intervention and the measurement of outcomes.
* **Fewer protocol amendments:** Protocol amendments often cause delays and dramatically increase the costs of developing new therapies. The potential for fewer research sites in a DCT leads to fewer institutional review boards and a corresponding reduction in regulatory costs and increased flexibility around protocol changes.
* In phase II studies, the typical decentralized clinical trial (DCT) deployment produced a [400%](https://github.com/cure-dao/docs/blob/main/assets/financial-benefits-of-decentralized-trials.pdf) return on investment in terms of trial cost reductions.
* In phase III studies, decentralization produced a [1300%](https://github.com/cure-dao/docs/blob/main/assets/financial-benefits-of-decentralized-trials.pdf) return on investment.
