# ðŸŽ­ More Cures and Less Lifelong Attempts at Masking Symptoms

If the new treatment is a permanent cure for the disease, replacing a lifetime of refills with a one-time purchase would be economically disastrous for the drug developer. With a lifetime prescription, a company can recover its costs over time. Depending on the number of people with the disease, one-time cures would require a massive upfront payment to recover development costs.

How is there any financial incentive for medical progress at all?

Fortunately, there isn't a complete monopoly on treatment development. However, the more expensive it is to get a drug to market, the fewer companies can afford the upfront R\&D investment. So the drug industry inevitably becomes more monopolistic. Thus, there are more situations where the cost of trials for a superior treatment exceeds the profits from existing treatments.
