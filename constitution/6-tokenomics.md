# Futarchy-Based Efficacy Trials

Medical experts will receive soul-bound non-transferable deFDA Credential NFTs (FDA-CRED) will be issued to all members
of the American Medical Association (AMA) and other international bodies which verify medical credentialing.

One deFDA fungible Reputation Token (FDA-REP) will be airdropped to holder of FDA-NFTs for each intervention that is
proposed for a specified population.

Initially only interventions that have passed phase I and II safety trials or are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS)
by the US FDA may be proposed.

Medical experts can stake their token in one of three pools based on their belief for the experimental population
relative to those who did not receive the intervention:
 1. "Uncertain Pool" - they are uncertain of the outcome of the intervention
 2. "Harmful Pool" - intervention will result in a relative net average DECREASE in healthspan
 3. "Helpful Pool" - intervention will result in a relative net average INCREASE in healthspan

If they do nothing, it will be assumed that they did not review the proposal.

Post-marketing pharmacovigilence data will be collected from the participants and used to determine the relative change
.
