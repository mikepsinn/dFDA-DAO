# 🪙 Quests and Tokens

CureDAO is built on the [Aragon](https://client.aragon.org/#/curedao1) DAO platform. The unit of democratic power in CureDAO is the $GCURES tokens on the Harmony blockchain.

$GCURES tokens give you control over CureDAO and how it allocates its resources.

$GCURES tokens are awarded for the completion of quests and experiments that advance the CureDAO mission. Quests and Experiments are outlined in Clickup Tasks
